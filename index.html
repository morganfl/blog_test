							Paris was the first destination I travelled to this year. I was really excited because it is one of the most famous cities
							in the world and I’ve always wanted to cross this off my destinations I needed to go to. This trip came about when my dad was visiting Paris on a work trip.
							He usually does them across the UK but this was the first time in Paris. Since I knew he was able to book a double room for his overnight stays, I asked if
							I could come along and stay in the hotel but pay for my own return tickets.
							The journey there was surprisingly long! I decided to save money and get a flixbus from London to Paris.
